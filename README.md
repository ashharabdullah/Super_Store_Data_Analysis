Superstore KPI Analytics Project
🚀 Project Overview

This project explores the Superstore dataset to define, calculate, and visualize Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that measure business performance. The goal was to learn how to go from raw data → KPIs → insights → business actions.

The analysis covers:

Sales, Orders, Customers, and Profitability

Regional performance

Customer and product insights

Trends over time

A dashboard with KPIs and visuals
